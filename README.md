# Workflow diagram builder

This module provides methods to create a BPMN diagram from a JSON blueprint spec. The BPMN diagram is described in the [BPMN XML standard](https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/), the same used in tools as [Cawemo](https://cawemo.com/).

The diagram construction is based in the paper "[A simple algorithm for automatic layout of bpmn processes](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221542866_A_Simple_Algorithm_for_Automatic_Layout_of_BPMN_Processes)" KITZMANN, Ingo, et al.Â 2009
